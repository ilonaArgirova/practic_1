                <h1>What is Lemon Tea?</h1>
                <p><br>Lemon Tea is a refreshing tea where lemon juice is added in black or green tea.
                   It soothes the throat, prevents cough and congestion, and helps in weight loss.</p>
                <p><br>To make this easy and quick tea, black tea is boiled in the water for a few minutes and then strained in a cup.
                   Add lemon juice, honey, and give it a mix. Your tea is ready!</p>
                <p><br>You can even add in some mint leaves while boiling the tea, it adds a great flavor and makes your tea even more refreshing.
                   You can even make Lemon Iced Tea, just let the strained water come to room temperature, add in some ice cubes and then add in some lemon juice and honey.</p>
